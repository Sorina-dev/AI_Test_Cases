## Manual Testing Analysis Template – User Story Review

**Role:** Manual QA Specialist

**Objective:**  
To validate the functionality described in the user story through structured manual testing, ensuring it meets business and user expectations.

**Details:**  
- Review the user story and associated acceptance criteria  
- Identify functional and non-functional requirements  
- Determine UI elements, workflows, and data inputs involved  
- Understand dependencies (e.g., APIs, file uploads, user roles)

**Examples:**  
- Valid submission with all required fields and receipt  
- Missing receipt triggers validation error  
- Unsupported transport type is not selectable  
- Multiple expenses submitted under one request  
- Approval workflow transitions from "Submitted" → "Approved"

**Scope:**  
- Includes: UI validation, form behavior, workflow transitions, file upload checks  
- Excludes: Automation testing, performance testing, backend database validation  
- Assumptions: User is authenticated, environment is stable, test data is available  
- Constraints: Must comply with PCI standards, simulate third-party API failures
