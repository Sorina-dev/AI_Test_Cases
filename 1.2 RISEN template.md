## Manual QA User Story Analysis Template

**Role:** Manual QA Specialist

**Input:**  
User Story: Submit Transport Expense - As an employee, I want to submit a transport expense for travel-related costs such as taxi or train fares, so that I can be reimbursed for necessary business transportation.

Acceptance Criteria:  
- AC1: The user can select "Transportation" as an Other Expense category
- AC2: The user can specify the transport type (Taxi, Train, Bus)
- AC3: The user can enter Amount, Date, and Short description for each transport cost
- AC4: The user must upload a receipt or proof of payment for each transport expense
- AC5: The request supports submission of multiple transport expenses under one transportation reimbursement request
- AC6: Transport expenses follow the standard approval process (Manager review, Finance validation, Final approval)

---

**Steps:**  
1. Review the user story and acceptance criteria for clarity and completeness.  
2. Identify **happy path** scenarios based on expected user behavior.  
3. Identify **error scenarios** including edge cases and validation failures.  
4. Design manual test cases covering:
   - UI interactions  
   - Field validations  
   - Workflow transitions  
   - File uploads or external dependencies  
5. Prepare test data for both valid and invalid inputs.  
6. Document expected results for each test case.  
7. Validate against business rules and compliance requirements.

## ✅ ANALYSIS RESULTS

### 1. Story Review & Completeness Assessment

**Clarity Issues Identified:**
- Missing details on file size limits for receipt uploads
- No specification of maximum amount limits per expense
- Unclear if transport type list is exhaustive or expandable
- Missing validation rules for date ranges (past/future dates)
- No mention of currency handling for international travel

**Completeness Gaps:**
- Missing error handling scenarios
- No specification of receipt format validation rules
- Unclear approval workflow timeframes
- Missing integration with existing expense management system

### 2. Happy Path Scenarios

**HP01:** Single Transport Expense Submission
- User selects Transportation category
- Selects transport type (Taxi)
- Enters valid amount, date, description
- Uploads valid receipt (PDF/JPG)
- Submits successfully
- Follows approval workflow

**HP02:** Multiple Transport Expenses Submission
- User creates multiple transport entries in one request
- Each with different transport types
- All with valid receipts
- Submits batch successfully

**HP03:** Complete Approval Workflow
- Manager reviews and approves
- Finance validates amounts and receipts
- Final approval granted
- Employee receives reimbursement notification

### 3. Error Scenarios & Edge Cases

**ES01:** Field Validation Failures
- Empty required fields (amount, date, description)
- Invalid amount formats (negative, zero, special characters)
- Future dates beyond policy limits
- Description exceeding character limits

**ES02:** File Upload Failures
- Unsupported file formats (e.g., .txt, .exe)
- Files exceeding size limits
- Corrupted files
- Missing receipts for required expenses

**ES03:** Business Logic Violations
- Duplicate expenses for same date/amount
- Amounts exceeding policy limits
- Transport type not in approved list
- Submission outside allowed time window

### 4. Manual Test Cases Design

| Test ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|---------|-----------|-------|----------------|----------|
| TC01 | Submit single taxi expense | 1. Select Transportation<br>2. Choose Taxi<br>3. Enter valid data<br>4. Upload receipt<br>5. Submit | Request created successfully | High |
| TC02 | Submit multiple transport expenses | 1. Add first expense<br>2. Add second expense<br>3. Fill all details<br>4. Upload receipts<br>5. Submit | Batch request created | High |
| TC03 | Validate required fields | 1. Leave amount blank<br>2. Attempt submission | Error: "Amount is required" | High |
| TC04 | Test file format validation | 1. Upload .txt file as receipt | Error: "Invalid file format" | Medium |
| TC05 | Test approval workflow | 1. Submit expense<br>2. Manager approves<br>3. Finance validates<br>4. Final approval | Status updates correctly | High |
| TC06 | Test amount validation | 1. Enter negative amount<br>2. Submit | Error: "Amount must be positive" | Medium |
| TC07 | Test date validation | 1. Enter future date<br>2. Submit | Error or warning message | Medium |
| TC08 | Test file size limits | 1. Upload 50MB receipt | Error: "File too large" | Low |
